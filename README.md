Key Metrics
Total Revenue: The total income generated from all bookings.
Total Bookings: The count of all room bookings made.
Occupancy Rate: The percentage of occupied rooms relative to total available rooms.
Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR): A measure of profitability, calculated as total revenue divided by available rooms.
Approach
Data was cleaned and processed in Power BI.
Created visualizations to highlight key metrics.
Used DAX measures to calculate complex KPIs such as RevPAR and average revenue.
Filtered data to allow interactive exploration by date, booking channel, and room type.
Key Insights
Room occupancy rates peak during certain months, indicating high demand seasons.
Online booking channels contribute significantly to total revenue.
Certain room types generate more revenue due to higher demand and pricing.
Tools Used
Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
DAX for advanced calculations and metrics.
Conclusion
The dashboard offers a clear view of the hotel's financial performance and booking trends, helping management adjust pricing and improve room occupancy strategies.
